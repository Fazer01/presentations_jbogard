Crafting wicked domain models

Why do I care?
When should I care?
Disclaimers
- Does your ORM support it?
- Does it matter?
- Can I wait to do it?
What's our aim?
- Domain model that represents business data AND behavior
- Encapsulation
- Domain model satisfies invariants of operations
- Consistency
Dirty little secret
- All about code smells and OO, with a bent towards capturing business concepts
- We're not going to get it right the first time
- Let's make it "good enough" and trust tests, code smells and model smells to guide us
Our domain
- Pulled from a real-world project, capturing real-world refactorings
- Members receive rewards
- Members can claim offers



















Refactorings:
- Compose method
-- Method for calculate offer value, expiration date, assign offer, and save offer
-- Let's go to each method
- Extract class
-- Extract class from method
- Rename method (CalculateOfferValue -> Calculate)
- Extract interface
- Field, use base type where possible
- Introduce parameter
-- Also add the DI configuration

- Move member (Calculate expiration date -> OfferType)
- Make member non-static
-- Undo, then make member non-static

- Primitive obsession
-- Offer Expiration Type - sliding/absolute
-- Create enumeration classes
-- Make switch just use constants
-- Move method to enum class
-- Extract method and make method non-static for OfferType
-- Calculate based on double dispatch w/ offer type
-- EF Core, use OnModelCreating, modelBuilder.Entity.Property(...).HasConversion()



- Encapsulate collection
-- For member -> offer
-- Want to have bi-directional relationship
-- Bunch of actions I don't support
-- Member.AddOffer
--- Extract method, make method non-static

- Encapsulated operations
-- Member.AssignOffer()

- Introduce constructor
-- Adding Member to offer ctor
- Private setters
-- Removing Offer.MemberAssigned()
- Double dispatch
-- calculating discount percentage
